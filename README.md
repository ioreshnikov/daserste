# Das Erste

Telegram chat visualizer. The name is a badly executed pun referring both to the name of the original Telegram chat it was written for and the name of a channel on public German television.

## Installation

The reporter is a simple stand-alone script that requires no installation. The dependencies to the script are listed in the requirements file `requirements.txt`. You can install them by executing the following command

    $ python -m pip install -r requirements

We strongly advise you do that in a virtual environment.

## Exporting the data

To export the chat data please on three vertical dots in the top right corner and select "Export chat history" from the context menu. Since we analyze only the message history and ignore all the content, you can skip all the media during the exporting. This will save you some disk space and time.
